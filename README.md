# Orestâ€™s dotfiles

## Installation

### Using Git and the install script

Clone the repository. Use the `install.sh` to install the dotfiles.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oleshch/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source install.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source install.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source install.sh
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
./brew.sh
```
